# Axis Align (Blender Add-on)
Axis Align is a lightweight Blender add-on that helps you precisely align an object's local axis to the view direction, or another object. Includes an option for minimizing unwanted twisting.

## Features
### Align Axis to View
- Rotate selected objects so a chosen local axis points in the current view direction.

### Align Axis to Active Object
- Point the selected axis of one or more objects directly at the active object.

### Align Axis Without Twist
- Maintains upright orientation when aligning to a target, with minimal rotation around the alignment axis.

### Flexible Axis Selection
- Choose from any of the six local axes (+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z) to define alignment direction.

## Installation
- Drag AxisAlign.zip into the Blender window.

## Requirements
- Blender 2.93 or later
